Early phase demo; major interfaces are still WIP.

Currently includes:
* Direct3D12 graphics pipeline with RAII wrapper types
* Vertex skinning with Box2D objects as control points
* dear imgui overlay (early)
* audio effects and controller/input support (early)
* event handling with boost::coroutines
* FBX_SDK mesh loading
* Qt adapter (works with D3D12; but early and not part of the working demo)
